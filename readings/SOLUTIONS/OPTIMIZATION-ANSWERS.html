<h4>Question 1</h4>
<b> Removing a redundant load: </b>
Checking for <tt>if(true)</tt> contributes to redundant load.
<p>
<b> Jump to Jump Replacement: </b>
The <tt>return</tt> statement inside the if block contributes to a jump to jump replacement.
<h4> Question 2</h4>
Right after the line <tt>#if-then</tt>, there is a equence of instructions that is a no-op. This corresponds to <tt>if(true)</tt> in the code. Similarly, immediately after the line <tt>#if-then-else</tt> there is another check for <tt>if(true)</tt> which is a no-op.
<p>
<tt>_L2</tt> has a jump to <tt>main_Exit</tt> immediately. Can be replaced with just <tt>main_Exit</tt> thus eliminating <tt>_L2</tt>.</p>

Some examples of loops for which the compiler can be sure that the
loop will execute at least once:
<UL>
   <LI> a repeat loop, i.e., a loop of the form:
        <pre>
	do {
	   &lt; statements &gt;
	while (&lt;condition&gt;)
	</pre>
   <LI> a for loop with a header like this:
   <br><tt>  for (int k = &lt;low&gt;; k < &lt;high&gt;; k++)
   </tt><br> where &lt;low&gt; and &lt;high&gt; can be evaluated at
       compile time (e.g., they are both literal values), and
       &lt;low&gt;is less than &lt;high&gt;.
  <P>
  <LI> a while loop whose initial condition can be evaluated
       at compile time after some simple optimizations like
       copy propagation; for example:
       <pre>
       x = 0;
       while (x &lt; 10) { ... }
       </pre>
</UL>

As illustrated immediately below this question, a Java compiler
doesn't have to give up on this optimization.
A for-loop that uses literals as the low and high bounds,
use <tt>i++</tt> (where <tt>i</tt> is the loop-index variable)
as the increment, and doesn't assign to <tt>i</tt> inside
the loop is a perfect candidate.

Strength reduction can still be done if the loop-index variable
is incremented by any constant amount.
The only change is to change
<UL>
  <LI> incrementing the temporary by <tt>k1</tt> at the end of the loop
</UL>
to
<UL>
  <LI> incrementing the temporary by <tt>increment</tt> * <tt>k1</tt>
       at the end of the loop
</UL>
Note that the expression <tt>increment</tt> * <tt>k1</tt>
can be evaluated at compile time, so the increment of the
temporary still only involves one addition (or subtraction),
and no multiplications.
