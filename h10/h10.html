<h2 id="Questions">Homework 10</h2>
<b>Due: 11pm April 28th 2020 </b>
<p>
For the final project, you generate code for expressions
as discussed in class: the <tt>codeGen</tt> method for each kind
of expression will generate code to evaluate the expression, leaving
the value on the stack.
</p>

<p class="reg">
While this kind of code is easy to generate, storing intermediate
values on the stack rather than in registers is inefficient.
You might think we could instead require that the <tt>codeGen</tt>
method for an expression should work as follows:
</p>

<ol class="reg">
  <li>Each expression node's <tt>codeGen</tt> method would have
       1 parameter: a register number N, which would be either 0 or 1.</li>
  <li>For literals or identifiers, the <tt>codeGen</tt> method
       would simply load the appropriate value in register N.</li>
  <li>For expressions involving non short-circuited
       binary operators (+, *, &lt;, etc.)
       the <tt>codeGen</tt> method would call the <tt>codeGen</tt>
       method of the left child with argument 0 (which would generate
       code to evaluate the left expression, leaving the result in register 0),
       then call the <tt>codeGen</tt> method of the right child with
       argument 1 (which would generate code to evaluate
       the right expression, leaving the result in register 1),
       then perform the operation, leaving the result in the
       appropriate register.</li>
</ol>

<p class="reg">
Unfortunately, this approach does not always work.
</p>

<h3 id="Question 1">Question 1:</h3>
<p class="reg">
Assume that the AST includes only expressions that involve non
short-circuited binary operators, with literals or identifiers
at the leaves (no unary operators, no dot-access expressions or function calls 
as operands). Also assume that in the generated code, all operands must be in 
registers (i.e., neither operand of a binary operator can be in a memory 
location, nor can it be a literal value).
</p>
<p class="reg">
  Show that the approach described above does not always work by giving two 
  examples:
  </p>
  <ol type="a" class="reg">
    <li><p>An expression that cannot be evaluated using just two
         registers (without storing intermediate results on the
         stack), but can be evaluated using three registers.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>An expression that cannot be evaluated using just three
         registers (without storing intermediate results on the
         stack), but can be evaluated using four registers.
    </p></li>
  </ol>
  <p class="reg">
  For each example, give the expression, the
  abstract-syntax tree, and a pseudo-code version of the code
  to evaluate the expression (code that works, <em>not</em> the erroneous code
  that would be generated using the approach described above).
  For example, here is an expression that <em>can</em> be
  evaluated using just two registers, its AST, and its
  pseudo-code (<b><em>use the same kind of pseudo-code in your answer</em></b>):
  </p>
  <dir>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th class="reg">expression</th>
      <th class="reg">AST</th>
      <th class="reg">pseudo code</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><pre>a - b</pre></td>
      <td>
  <pre>
     -
    / \
   a   b 
  </pre>
      </td>
      <td>
  <pre>
    load a into T0  
    load b into T1  
    T0 = T0 - T1
  </pre>
    </td>
  </table>
  </dir>
  <p class="reg">
  Note that an expression's operands need not be evaluated
  left-to-right.
  For example, the following pseudo-code would also be OK
  for the expression <tt>a - b</tt>:
  </p>
  <dir>
  <pre>
  load b into T1  // evaluate the right operand first
  load a into T0
  T0 = T0 - T1
  </pre>
  </dir>
<h3 id="Question 2">Question 2:</h3>
<p class="reg">
Use the same assumptions about the AST and the generated code as
for Question 1, including the fact that an expression's operands
can be evaluated either left-to-right or right-to-left.
Also assume that all operators are non-commutative and
non-associative (i.e., the expression <tt>a op b</tt> is
not equivalent to the expression <tt>b op a</tt>, and the
expression <tt>(a op b) op c</tt> is not equivalent to the
expression <tt>a op (b op c)</tt> ).
</p>
<p class="reg">
  You are to give a recursive algorithm that works as follows:
</p>
<ul class="reg">
  <li>
    <p>The input to the algorithm is an expression
       node in the AST (recall from Question 1 that we are assuming that we only have expressions involving non short-circuited binary operators).</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>The output of the algorithm is the number of registers
       required to generated code for the <em>whole</em>
       expression.
  </p>
  <p>Note that generating code to evaluate a leaf node requires one register (into 
which the value of the identifier or literal is loaded). </p>
  <p>For non-leaf nodes, your algorithm
    should recursively calculate the number of registers required to generate code
    for the left operand (leaving the value in a register)
    and the number of registers required to generate code
    for the right operand (leaving the value in a register) and then determine the number of registers required for the entire expression represented by the node.</p>
  
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="reg">In other words, complete the following method:</p>
<dir>
<pre>int numRegisters(ASTNode node) {
    // add code to calculate and return the number of
    // registers required to generate code for the whole
    // expression (whose root is node)
}</pre></dir>
<p class="reg">You may use pseudo-code such as <tt>node.leftChild</tt>, <tt>node.rightChild</tt>,  <tt>max(paramA,paramB)</tt>, <tt>min(paramA,paramB)</tt>, and <tt>node.isLeaf()</tt>.</p>

<p class="reg">
For example, for the expression <tt>a - b</tt>, the input to
the algorithm is the root node of the expression tree.
The algorithm will recursively determine that the number of registers required to generate code for each operand is 1 (because each operand is a leaf and thus requires
one register).
The output of the algorithm for this example should be 2 (because
the whole expression can be evaluated using two registers, as
illustrated above in Part 1, but it cannot be evaluated using
just one register).
