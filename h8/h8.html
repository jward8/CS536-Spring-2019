Assume we have a language that allows arrays and parameters in this language to be passed
by value, by reference, by value-result, or by name.
Consider the following  program:
</p>
<dir>
<pre>int A[4];
int k;

void f( int x, int y ) {
    x = x + 2;
    k = k + 1;
    A[k] = A[k] * 2;
    y = y - 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; x;
    cout &lt;&lt; y;
    cout &lt;&lt; k;
    cout &lt;&lt; A[k];
}

void main() {
    k = 0;
    while (k < 4) {
	A[k] = k - 1;
        k = k + 1;
    }
    k = 0; 
    f(k, A[k]);
    cout &lt;&lt; k;
    cout &lt;&lt; A[3];
    cout &lt;&lt; A[2];
    cout &lt;&lt; A[1];
    cout &lt;&lt; A[0];
}

</pre>

Below is a link to a file that contains six pictures.
The first four pictures contain outlines
of <tt>f</tt>'s activation record, as well as the
space in the static data area for globals <tt>k</tt> and
<tt>A</tt>.
The last two pictures contain space for recording the
output of the program.
</p>

<p class="reg">
You need to complete the pictures:
</p>

<ul class="reg">
  <li><p>For the first four pictures, you should fill in the values for
all of the variables as they would be just before function <tt>f</tt>
returns.
For each picture, assume the parameter-passing modes
for <tt>f</tt>'s parameters indicated in that picture.</p>
  </li>  
  
  <li>
    <p>For the last two pictures, you should fill in the values that would
be printed by functions <tt>f</tt> and <tt>main</tt>, assuming
that <tt>f</tt>'s parameters are both passed by value-result
or both passed by name (as indicated in the pictures).
  </li>
  </ul>
